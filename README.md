# Sum_By_index
 The function named SumByIndex takes a 2D vector of ints and returns a 1D vector of ints. The vector returned should be the sum of all of the argument’s subvectors at that position.


For instance, if the argument was {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 9}} the correct return value would be {5, 11, 3} because 5 is the sum of 1 and 4, and 11 is the sum of 2 and 9. Please note that not all of the subvectors will be the same length, so be careful not to index out of bounds.
